			<h1> Top 3 Basketball teams of All Time </h1>

			<h2>
			1995-1996 Chicago Bulls </h2>
			<p>A phenomenal team that finished with a record of 72-10 in a star packed era says it all. And by the way
      they had Michael Jordan.</p>

			<h2>
			2016-2017 Golden State Warriors </h2>
			<p>A team that was 73-9 the season before adds one of the best scorers of all time in Kevin Durant.
      It has 4 hall of famers on the roster, and ran through the entire NBA that season.</p>

			<h2>
			1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
			<p>History is sometimes forgotten. But this star packed team in the 70's is not. They still hold the record for a 33 game win 
      streak which is a feat that may not be beaten in a long time. They ran through the NBA this season to secure a title with ease.</p>
